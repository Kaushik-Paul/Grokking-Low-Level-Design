## Problem Definition

**Snakes and Ladders** is a classic board game for two or more players. The game is played on a square board with numbered cells, some of which are connected by snakes (which move the player down) or ladders (which move the player up). Players take turns rolling dice to advance their tokens from the starting cell (usually 0) to the last cell on the board. The first player to reach or surpass the final cell wins. The game is simple yet engaging, and is often used as an example for turn-based game mechanics and basic object-oriented design.

The main challenges in designing the system include:
- Representing the board, snakes, and ladders efficiently.
- Managing player turns and moves.
- Handling the effects of landing on snakes or ladders.
- Supporting extensibility for different board sizes, dice types, or rule variations.

## Requirements

1. **Board Initialization:** The board must be square (e.g., 10x10) and initialized with a configurable number of snakes and ladders, each placed at random but valid positions.
2. **Snakes:** Each snake has a head (higher-numbered cell) and a tail (lower-numbered cell). Landing on a snake's head moves the player down to its tail.
3. **Ladders:** Each ladder has a bottom (lower-numbered cell) and a top (higher-numbered cell). Landing on a ladder's bottom moves the player up to its top.
4. **Players:** The game supports two or more players. Each player starts at cell 0 and takes turns in a round-robin fashion.
5. **Dice Rolls:** On their turn, a player rolls one or more dice and moves forward by the total rolled value.
6. **Snakes and Ladders Effect:** After moving, if a player lands on a cell with a snake or ladder, their position is updated accordingly. Multiple jumps (e.g., ladder to snake) are handled.
7. **Winning Condition:** The first player to reach or cross the last cell on the board is declared the winner. The game ends immediately when a winner is found.
8. **Multiple Dice Support:** The system should support rolling multiple dice, with configurable minimum and maximum values.
9. **Extensibility:** The design should allow for easy changes, such as custom board sizes, additional rules, or new features (e.g., power-ups, obstacles).

## System Design

### Class Structure

- **Main:** Entry point of the application. Instantiates the Game and starts the gameplay loop.
- **Game:** Manages the overall game flow, including initializing the board, handling player turns, rolling dice, moving players, checking for snakes/ladders, and determining the winner.
- **Board:** Represents the game board as a 2D array of `Cell` objects. Responsible for initializing cells, placing snakes and ladders, and providing access to cell details.
- **Cell:** Represents a single cell on the board. May contain a `Jump` (either a snake or a ladder) or be empty.
- **Jump:** Represents a connection between two cells (start and end). Used for both snakes (start > end) and ladders (start < end).
- **Player:** Represents a player in the game. Tracks the player's name (ID) and current position on the board.
- **Dice:** Handles dice rolling logic. Supports rolling multiple dice and configurable value ranges.

### Class Interactions
- The `Game` class initializes the `Board` and creates `Player` objects.
- On each turn, the `Game` asks the current `Player` to roll the `Dice` and moves their token accordingly.
- The `Board` provides access to the `Cell` at a given position. If the cell contains a `Jump`, the player's position is updated.
- The game continues until a `Player` reaches or passes the last cell.

### Design Patterns Used
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Encapsulates responsibilities in dedicated classes.
- **Extensibility:** The system is designed for easy modification (e.g., changing board size, dice type, or adding new rules).

## Extensibility & Enhancements
- **Custom Rules:** Add new types of jumps (e.g., power-ups, penalties), or custom win conditions.
- **UI Integration:** Integrate with a GUI or web interface for interactive play.
- **Persistence:** Save/load game state for resuming games.
- **Statistics:** Track player statistics, number of games played/won, etc.
