## Problem Defination -
A **parking lot** is a designated area for parking vehicles and 
is a feature found in almost all popular venues such as 
shopping malls, sports stadiums, offices, etc. 
In a parking lot, there are a fixed number of parking spots 
available for different types of vehicles. Each of these 
spots is charged according to the time the vehicle has been 
parked in the parking lot. The parking time is tracked with a 
parking ticket issued to the vehicle at the entrance of the
parking lot. Once the vehicle is ready to exit, it can either 
pay at the automated exit panel or to the parking agent at the 
exit using a card or cash payment method.

    - Car

5. The parking lot should have a display board that shows free parking spots for each parking spot type.
6. The system should not allow more vehicles in the parking lot if the maximum capacity (40,000) is reached.
7. If the parking lot is completely occupied, the system should show a message on the entrance and on the parking lot display board.
8. Customers should be able to collect a parking ticket from the entrance and pay at the exit.
9. The customer can pay for the ticket either with an automated exit panel or pay the parking agent at the exit.
